# Online-Support-Ticketing-System

This is an Online Support Ticketing System which helps the students to create a ticket for an issue or concern, if not alrady exists, or like or support a pre-existing issue or concern.
There can be multiple users, like student, support staff and support admins.User can register as any, but they are verified by support admin. Only after verificaton by support admin, they will be able to access the application.
When support staff has resolved an issue or concern, they will mark the ticket as resolved and notifications for all concerned users will be sent via mail (using mailhog).
If there are multiple queries on same issue, the support admin can convert it into FAQs with proper tags for categorization of the FAQs. New students, i.e., student who are not verified by the support admin can also access the FAQs.
